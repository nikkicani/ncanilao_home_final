<p>Ever since I was a child, I have applied myself to the arts as an escape from my reality that I was currently living in. When I got to high school I was exposed to different types of art: dark room photography, digital photography, and regular art class where I learned how to use different mediums of art and different eras of art. During my junior and senior year of high school, I was given the opportunity to take graphic design classes across my high school at a career center.</p>
	
<p>After graduating high school in 2017, I applied myself to Specs Howard (before they merged with LTU) to the Graphic Design Program. I won a competition that allowed me to get a half ride, as well as gradating on the top of my class with two awards: highest GPA 4.0, as well as an award that explains my passion for my field.</p>
	
<p>After three years, winter of 2020. I applied myself to expand on my certificate from Specs Howard to get my associates degree. Where I found myself for the next four to five years at Henry Ford College.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to graduating from HFC the winter of 2025. </p>
